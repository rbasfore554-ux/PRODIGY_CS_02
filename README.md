# PRODIGY_CS_02 - Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption 🖼️🔐

## 📌 Task
This is Task 2 of the **Cyber Security Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**.

✅ The objective is to create a Python tool to **encrypt and decrypt images** using **pixel-level mathematical manipulation**.

---

## 💡 How It Works
- Each pixel’s RGB value is modified by adding or subtracting a key.
- The process is reversible using the same key.
- You can encrypt any image and decrypt it later with the correct key.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pillow (`PIL`)
- NumPy

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy
